## Description

_Duration: 1 weekend_

This project was to creat a web page where you would be able to input employee information and store the data on the webpage. To accomplish this we created input fields for employee first name, last name, employee ID number, job title, and yearly salary that would all be stored in an array. From the collection of data the webpage would calculate the monthly cost of all employees and will display a red total monthly cost if it ever exceeds $20,000. where is also a feture to delete employee information from the page with a 'delete' button next tot the employees information on the table.
